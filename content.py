In particular, we plan to examine the efficiency of both energy distribution and water treatment systems and compare the environmental impact of systems in tiny homes with those in other buildings. This comparison could elucidate methods and trends of minimizing negative environmental impact of residential structures.</p>

                    <p>Many tiny homes such as those created by Berkeley group THIMBY are already be designed for minimizing environmental impact. We will analyze the effectiveness of such designs, particularly in regards to belt elation and CO2 emissions and the gray water treatment systems.</p>

                    <h4>Our Motivation and Project Overview</h4>

                    <p class="lead">Everyone loves food, but sometimes food is deadly. Food is essential, not only to survival, but also to students’ well-being now and in the future. Thus, we are interested in examining the impact of cooking under various circumstances on students’ long-term health.</p>

                    <p>There has been large amount of news that relates certain food types to the potential risk of cancer, such as the New York Times report on the presence of carcinogens in bacon, one of the most popular breakfast items in America.</p>
                    <p>In this research, we plan on measuring carcinogen levels in different meats and possibly vegetables taken from different source that a Berkeley student is likely to get food from such as the dining hall, popular restaurants, or food cooked at home using different cooking methods.</p>
                    <p>We noticed that students’ level of exposure to carcinogens from cooking on a daily basis is unknown. So to figure out the exact risks theses substances exert on the student community, we need to identify the extent of damage each of our samples are capable of in regards to human health.</p>
                    <p>Since people aren’t usually well aware of the recent research into carcinogens and wouldn’t notice the risks of food that is common, they often assume that the food they consume everyday is safe. In the light of the situation, we find our research significant for the Berkeley community.</p>

                    <h4>Our Research So Far</h4>

                    <p>We have reviewed literatures that have found correlations between certain chemicals to cancer through animal studies and those that have explained the mechanisms of relevant reactions that relate to the formation of the carcinogens. Our research is going to dig deeper into what exactly these carcinogens are and the chemical reactions that make them carcinogenic. For the vegetable part of the experiment, we reviewed past research on the effects of different cooking methods on the nutritional compounds in vegetables, such as vitamins and antioxidants.</p>

                    <h4>Our Questions</h4>

                    <p>Based off our experiments, we want to answer:  How do different cooking methods affect levels of carcinogens in processed meat (PCA) and charring (benzylpyrenes) Cooking times, Different types of meats (hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken), different food groups (vegetables)?</p>

                    <p>A question we want to answer through means other than experimental research is: are people aware of potentially carcinogenic foods and if so, to what extent?  Possible way of obtaining such information may include surveys, interviews and observations.</p>

                    <p>Based off our research so far, we plan to try utilizing either an extraction procedure, which involves crushing up the meat, filtering particles, and extracting organic solvents, or HPLC by UV absorbance to detect carcinogenic molecules in our different samples.</p>

                    <h4>Additional topics for Future Research</h4>

                    <p>An additional topic we will potentially explore next semester are whether Berkeley students are getting enough vitamin C by measuring vitamin C levels in samples of various foods obtained from the dining hall.  To supplement this research, we want to determine how many people are taking vitamin supplements and whether there is a correlation between how people who take vitamin supplements are feeling  and performing academically.</p>

                    <p>Another topic that we want to explore is how we can use nanoparticles to improve water purification systems by experimenting using the water purification system in the THIMBY house on campus. The experiment would test on the system’s ability to exclude harmful chemicals such as heavy metal ions and contaminants out of the water body, and proper control would be carry out using no filter and regular filters.</p>

                    <h4>Motivations</h4>

                    <p>We noticed many people in our dorm getting sick around the same time. The problems of getting sick include reduction in productivity, inability to attend class/discussions/labs, negative impact emotional/mental health, and additional financial burden</p>

                        <li>Does dining hall food cause digestive problems?</li>
                        <li>Do people who get more plates at dining hall experience more digestive problems?</li>
                        <li>Does the number of people you come in contact with affect the amount you get sick?</li>

                        <li>Do different residence halls get sick at different rates?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Methods and Results</h4>

                    <p>We started by sending out a preliminary survey covering demographics and personal hygiene. 36 students replied and we are working on graphing the results of each respective area to find correlations. This was our first health survey designed to attack the problem of sickness in college settings.</p>
